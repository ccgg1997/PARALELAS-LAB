    "## Parallel regions\n",
    "Since its origin, OpenMP has focus on parallel regions. Parallel regions are created with the `#pragma omp parallel` directive, and its purpose is to generate a collection of software threads, each entering the same region of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `parallel` construct generates a `team of threads` containing one or more threads. \n",
    "__There are different factors that influence how many threads are created and the user have some control over these__. \n",
    "One factor that we cannot control as users is the system limitation. OpenMP is portable across systems, however, each system may impose limitations on how many threads can be generated. \n",
    "For example, __an embedded system with a light weight operating system may not allow thread oversubscription__ (see lab 1 for details on this), a batch scheduler may restrict the number of threads in an application, or an OpenMP compiler implementation may decide to limit the number of threads it can handle to a maximum number.\n",
    "\n",
    "âš¡__There are two rules of thumb__:\n",
    "1. â›” __Number of threads used by the application is not guaranteed to be equal to the number of threads requested__. The actual number of threads may be less or implementation defined. It is not a good idea for applications to rely on the number of threads as this will limit portability (Use discretion here, as there are good reasons to break this rule.)\n",
    "2. ðŸš« __System oversubscription is not recommended, when all the threads will be constantly busy__, as this has demonstrated to reduce application performance. Still, some applications use thread oversubscription to have some threads that do little work. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Elements that affect the number of threads:\n",
    "* The `OMP_NUM_THREADS` environment variable\n",
    "* The `omp_set_num_threads()` API call\n",
    "* The `num_threads()` clause of the `parallel` construct\n",
    "* The `if()` clause of the `parallel` construct\n",
    "* The `OMP_DYNAMIC` environment variable\n",
    "* The `omp_set_dynamic()` API call\n",
    "* The `thread_limit()` clause in the `teams` directive\n",
    "* The `OMP_THREAD_LIMIT` and `OMP_TEAMS_THREAD_LIMIT` environment variable\n",
    "* The `OMP_NESTED` and `OMP_MAX_ACTIVE_LEVELS` environment variables\n",
